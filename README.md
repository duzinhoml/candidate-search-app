# Candidate Search App

## Description

The Candidate Search Application is a React-based app built with TypeScript that allows employers to browse potential candidates for hire by retrieving data from the GitHub API. This app provides an intuitive interface for reviewing candidates' profiles, saving potential candidates to a shortlist, and viewing a list of saved candidates. It also allows employers to manage and interact with candidate data efficiently and is deployed on Render for public access.

## Features
